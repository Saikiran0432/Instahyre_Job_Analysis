## üìä Problem Aimed to Solve

In today's competitive job market, job seekers and employers face challenges in accessing insightful data for informed decision-making. Job seekers often struggle to find the right job opportunities that match their skills and preferences, while employers need to make data-driven decisions when posting job listings to attract the right talent. This project aims to address these challenges by:

1. Collecting job-related data from Instahyre through web scraping techniques.
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
3. Performing data exploration and analysis to extract meaningful insights.
4. Creating interactive visualizations to help users understand job market trends.
5. Presenting key findings that can guide job seekers and employers in their decision-making processes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills

To accomplish these objectives, we utilized the following skills and tools:

- Python: For web scraping, data cleaning, and analysis.
- Excel: To create an interactive dashboard with visualizations.
- Data Cleaning: To ensure the quality and integrity of the collected data.

## üìã Data Collection

### Web Scraping

We employed a combination of Pandas, Requests, and the JSON library to scrape job data from Instahyre. This data extraction process included gathering essential information such as job titles, company names, job descriptions, job locations, and salary details.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Pre-processing

Data cleanliness is crucial for reliable insights. In this phase, we:

- Addressed noise, null values, and duplicate entries in the scraped data.
- Standardized data formats and handled missing data gracefully.
- Removed outliers to enhance the accuracy of our analysis.

## üìà Data Exploration and Analysis

### Overview

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was a pivotal step in gaining insights into the job market. Our analysis covered various aspects, including:

- Job distribution by location, revealing emerging job markets.
- Job categories and their prevalence.
- Salary ranges across different job categories, indicating potential salary negotiation points.

### Visualizations

We leveraged Excel's capabilities to create interactive visualizations and tables. These visualizations help users understand job market trends quickly and intuitively.
